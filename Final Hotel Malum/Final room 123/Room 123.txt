Room 123


Before you enter room 123, you look down towards your feet at the doormat. The doormat reads "Hello". Strange. You wipe your feet like the gentlemen you are and enter. As you open the door, a strange man with a briefcase stands across the room. He is standing straight up, with a creepy smile on his face.
