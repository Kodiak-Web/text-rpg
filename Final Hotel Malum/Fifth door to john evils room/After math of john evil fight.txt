"Mr. Evil, you are under arrest." - player

You fiercely walk over to the now knocked-out John Evil and you lock handcuffs on him with the force of three suns. You escort John Evil out of the building. You're proud. You've come so far. You should be proud, [PLAYER]. Thank you for playing this short game. It isn't anything crazy but we worked hard to get it to where it is now. Now what will you do from here? Well, that's up to you. Goodluck on your journey.
