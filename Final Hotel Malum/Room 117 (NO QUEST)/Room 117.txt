117 (You havent accepted Gideons quest yet)


You walk towards room 117 with caution. Something could be in here. As you step towards the door, you slowly open it and peek inside. As the door opens, nothing is wrong. All you see is a bed and a bedside table. Until the door is wide open, and in the corner, you see a construct. The flickering light is coming from the face of this thing. You start to creep inside, checking every corner. You walk towards the construct and inspect it. The screen is just a dim flickering white light. But suddenly, the screen changes! You become startled and back up a few steps. The screen suddenly displays two human-like eyes, which slowly turn towards you.
