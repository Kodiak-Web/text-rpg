Room 101 // This has Gideon but no quest attached




As you cautiously push open the door of 101, you're immediately met by a scene straight from a nightmare. Before you stands a man, his silhouette athed in the sickly glow of flickering lights, surrounded by the horrifying scene of his work. With a sinking feeling in your stomach, you watch in horror as the man brutally dismantles a mechanical construct, tearing it limb from limb with little to no effort. Oil splatters the floor. Frozen in place, you can only watch as the man's gaze slowly drifts to you, his eyes burning with a fierce intensity. He rises to his full height, towering over you. Every inch of you tells you to flee, but you can't. As he gets closer, his features become clearer. The dim light in the middle of the room reveals a figure weathered by time and grizzled with age. His mechanical hand reflects the light. He finally approaches you.
