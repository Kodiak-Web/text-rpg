Room 129 (first time entering)


The ordinary door of 129 gives you the creeps. The absence of abnormality is disturbing, but that doesn't stop you from entering. You enter the room with the thought of a normal room. For the most part, you're right. This room has nothing to it. No person, no robot, nothing. You look to your left and you notice a coat rack. A coat and a hat are tightly secured on the rack. You survey the room once more, but you can't find anybody. You decide to make your way to the door because you don't want to be caught disturbing a civilian's room, but you can't. The door is locked, and the lights quickly shut off. You can't see anything. The light abruptly turns back on, you notice the hat and coat missing. You turn around and you're face to face with a mysterious figure.
